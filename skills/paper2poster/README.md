# paper2poster

> Turn a paper's extracted assets into a print-ready, single-page academic poster — HTML + PDF + PNG + an editable PowerPoint — fitted to the page exactly.

`paper2poster` is the **rendering stage** of the ResearchStudio pipeline. It takes the `<outdir>/` bundle produced by [`paper2assets`](../paper2assets/), picks the figures, fills a fixed-canvas HTML template with the paper's 9-section spec, runs a measured loop until every section sits at the right density, narrates each section for the in-poster Listen buttons, and exports the result to PDF/PNG plus a natively-editable `.pptx` (via the bundled [`html2pptx`](html2pptx/) sub-skill).

```
paper2assets  ──▶  paper2poster  ──▶  html2pptx
  <outdir>/         poster.html        poster.pptx
                    poster.pdf / .png  (built in — same run)
```

## Input

A `paper2assets` `<outdir>/` containing (at minimum):

- `manifest.json`
- `assets/meta/paper_spec.md` — the 9-section structured summary
- `assets/meta/{text.txt, figures.json, metadata.json}`
- `assets/figures/*.png` — cleaned figure rasters
- `assets/logos/`, `assets/qr/` — optional, best-effort

Run `paper2assets` first if these are missing.

## Output

Written back into the same `<outdir>/`, next to `manifest.json` and `assets/`:

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `poster.html` | Self-fitting single-page poster (references `assets/` for figures + fonts). Press `s` for fullscreen, `a` to toggle Listen buttons, `d` for a debug overlay |
| `poster.pdf` | Print-ready PDF at the exact canvas size (Chromium print emulation) |
| `poster.png` | Thumbnail preview |
| `poster.pptx` | Editable PowerPoint — native text + shapes, not a PNG-in-slide (via html2pptx) |
| `assets/audio/*.mp3` | Per-section narration for the Listen buttons (free Edge TTS; skipped if unavailable) |

## Usage

From a Claude Code session:

```text
# point it at a paper2assets <outdir>/
> /paper2poster ./my_paper/

# …or describe what you want in natural language
> /paper2poster Render a portrait poster for arxiv 2502.06434 in teal
```

One run yields all four artifacts — you never call `html2pptx` separately.

## How it works

The lean first render holds only each section's essential text. A **measured fill loop** (`check_poster.py slack` + `polish`) then grows or shrinks content section-by-section until every card reads `FULL` (90–100% of its height) and every figure fills ≥90% of its card on at least one axis. At render time a final **expand** pass lifts under-filled cards toward ~98% and bakes the result back into `poster.html`, so the PDF, PNG, and PPTX all match.

## Two canvas presets

| Orientation | Size | Venues |
|---|---|---|
| **Landscape** (default) | 60 × 36 in (5:3) | NeurIPS · ICML · CVPR |
| **Portrait** (`POSTER_ORIENTATION=portrait`) | A0, 33.1 × 46.8 in | ACL · NAACL · AAAI |

Both orientations are **composed at build time** instead of selecting a monolithic template. Landscape uses `assets/layouts/{full,half,3col}.html`; Portrait uses `assets/layouts_portrait/{full,half}.html`. They share 9 themes and the same style sources, while each orientation has its own five-header family. Landscape enables all 11 styles; Portrait enables 9. The renderer routes by orientation, then by the Method figure's aspect ratio.

## Header, logos & QR

`references/compose_poster.py` combines independent axes into one self-contained file. Layout, style, header, and theme apply to both orientations; Scan-to-Read is Landscape-only:

- **Layout** — Landscape `assets/layouts/{full,half,3col}.html`; Portrait `assets/layouts_portrait/{full,half}.html`. Portrait Half has two columns with exactly one bottom `.grow` per column. Portrait Full has four content bands, including a `1.5fr 1fr 1fr` Results band and full-width Takeaway.
- **Style:** `assets/styles/*.css`. Landscape randomizes across all 11 visual treatments. Portrait excludes `underline` and `double-rule`, leaving 9 eligible styles, because those horizontal rules create misleading section divisions in narrow columns.
- **Header** — Landscape `assets/headers/{v1…v5}.html`; Portrait `assets/headers_portrait/{pv1…pv5}.html`. Each orientation randomizes across its own five-header pool. Portrait uses five structural arrangements: balanced triptych (`pv1`), full-width masthead over a navigation strip (`pv2`), left editorial copy followed by institution marks and an outer-right Venue/QR rail (`pv3`), the center-aligned reverse triptych of pv1 (`pv4`), and the mirrored outer-left Venue/QR plus institution marks beside right editorial copy (`pv5`). In the navigation variants, one vertical divider separates Venue/QR from institution marks while the marks remain adjacent to the paper information and retain an independent `fit_logos.py` zone.
- **Theme** — 9 shared academic palettes: blue · teal · green · burgundy · purple · rust · slate · plum · mono.
- **Scan** — Landscape only, from `assets/scan/{aside,hero,contact,directory,banner,twin,chips}.html`. The build picks `--scan single` (paper only) or `dual` (paper + code), then samples a fitting variant. Portrait has no standalone scan section or scan axis; its headers own the QR slots.

**Venue logo** — `paper2assets` best-effort fetches the conference mark (Wikipedia / Wikidata) into `assets/logos/_venue.png`; the header shows that logo and hides the venue-year text so the two never duplicate. The venue is always the **real conference / journal** — never "arXiv" (a preprint host is not a publication venue).

**Institution logos** — `references/fit_logos.py` packs the institution marks to fill the header zone at a single **uniform height** (every logo enlarges together, sized by the browser's true aspect ratio so even wide SVG wordmarks fit without overflowing the band). Its automatic completion is an allowlist operation: only accepted `logos[]` entries in `assets/logos/logos.json` may be injected, so orphan cover images and rejected or stale marks are not rendered merely because they remain in the directory. Historical `logos[]` entries without approval fields remain compatible. If the manifest is missing, the fitter adds nothing from disk and only preserves explicit HTML sources. `assets/logos/_venue.png` remains a separate conference resource. Landscape headers expose six logo slots; Portrait headers expose four.

**QR codes** — in Landscape, the Paper / Code QRs live in the **Scan to Read** section for headers v1–v4; the v5 classic header carries a QR in the title band itself. The **3col layout suppresses Scan-to-Read** and is kept off v5, so a 3col poster carries no QR. Portrait has no standalone Scan-to-Read section and uses only its selected `pv1`–`pv5` header's QR slots.

## Deterministic diversity for batches

The default `random` values are reproducible. Seed precedence is explicit `--seed`, then `POSTER_SEED`, then the resolved absolute `--out` path, so separate paper directories naturally receive different combinations.

For a 30+ paper gallery, pass consecutive zero-based `--variant-index` values with one shared `--variant-seed` (or `POSTER_VARIANT_SEED`). The sampler deterministically orders the joint random-axis combination space without replacement, so complete style/header/theme tuples do not repeat while unused combinations remain; it simultaneously keeps each axis marginally balanced. Landscape covers 11 styles in 11 posters; Portrait covers its 9 eligible styles in 9 posters; 5 posters cover all 5 Portrait headers; and 9 cover all 9 themes. Keep `--layout` driven by the Method figure unless layout itself should be sampled.

```bash
python references/compose_poster.py --orientation portrait \
  --layout full --style random --header random --theme random \
  --variant-index 17 --variant-seed portrait-wave-20260810 \
  --selection-out <outdir>/selection.json \
  --out <outdir>/poster.html
```

Every composed HTML embeds the resolved manifest in `#paper2poster-composition` and stamps the main axes on `<body data-poster-...>`. `--selection-out` writes the same metadata as external JSON for gallery audits and tests.

## Tuning knobs (env vars)

| Var | Default | Controls |
|---|---|---|
| `POSTER_ORIENTATION` | `landscape` | `landscape` or `portrait` |
| `POSTER_STYLE` | `random` | Landscape: 1 of 11; Portrait: 1 of 9, excluding `underline` and `double-rule` |
| `POSTER_HEADER` | `random` | Landscape `v1`–`v5`; Portrait `pv1`–`pv5` |
| `POSTER_THEME` | `random` | shared theme: 1 of 9 (`blue` … `mono`) |
| `POSTER_SEED` | resolved absolute output path | stable seed for ordinary random-axis selection; explicit `--seed` wins |
| `POSTER_VARIANT_SEED` | ordinary seed | shared batch seed used with `--variant-index` for balanced cycles |
| `POSTER_FONT` | `Arial` | any of 8 PPT-safe families (Arial round-trips with no font embedding) |
| `POSTER_FULL_THRESHOLD` | `0.90` | the fill-loop's FULL gate (raise for a tighter pack, ~2× loop time) |
| `POSTER_EXPAND_THRESHOLD` | `0.98` | render-time expand target (`0` disables) |
