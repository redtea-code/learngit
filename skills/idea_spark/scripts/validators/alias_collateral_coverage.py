"""alias_collateral_coverage validator: Phase 2.2's `alias_terms[]` must actually
query the cross-community families Phase 1 already named.

Why this exists — the omission was measured twice, in consecutive runs:

  Run `self-harness-holdout`: the collision pool never surfaced delta debugging /
  `ddmin` / 1-minimality or test-suite minimization. The Phase 3.2 audit found
  them by reading the candidate by hand and flagged the pool as defective.

  Run `skillopt-deploy-cost`: Phase 1 responded by pinning NINE collateral
  families into `method_lineage` (group testing, screening designs, ddmin,
  test-suite minimization, blame bisection, Shapley, McNemar, ...). Phase 2.2's
  `alias_terms[]` then queried ZERO of them, because the prompt asked for alias
  terms from parametric recall and said nothing about the list sitting in its
  own input file. The audit's own retrieval later found combinatorial-group-
  testing work carrying the candidate's exact observation model.

The mechanism of the failure is not laziness — it is that parametric recall
reaches for near neighbours in the writer's own vocabulary, while the collateral
list is by construction the FAR ones. The names were already written down
one phase earlier; nothing was reading them.

What it checks:
  For every `method_lineage.nodes[]` entry with `is_collateral: true`, at least
  one `alias_terms[]` entry shares >= MIN_SHARED distinctive tokens with that
  node's `method` name.

Severity split — deliberate, not hedging:
  * ZERO of N collateral nodes covered -> fail. This is the measured failure
    mode and it is unambiguous: the list was handed over and not opened.
  * SOME but not all covered -> warn, naming the uncovered families. A node can
    legitimately be unreachable from a given mechanism, and forcing a term for
    it would push a fabricated query into a channel that truncates by lexical
    relevance — i.e. a hard fail here would evict REAL terms to make room for
    noise. ideate_generate.txt asks for the skip to be justified in
    `composition_note`; the Phase 3.2 audit weighs whether that defense holds.
  * No collateral nodes at all (or no phase1 file) -> nothing to check.
